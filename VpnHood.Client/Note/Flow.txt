How a user knows that he has been disconnected by another session?

* Server keeps sessions alive for SessionTimeout
* Server keep disposed sessions info for SessionTimeout
* Any other session with same clientId will be closed on new session creation
* Any connections with closed session id is replied by an error message that indicates he was disconnected by another session
* Server doesn't return any error message if sessionId is not detected! no fingerprint to prevent server query

Normal Connection
* Try to connect
* if failed run pre-connection test to check network

Diagnose Connection
* dianose all tests and provide best message
* Keep connection alive if client connected
